-Need to fix direction of explosion
-Appears to be adding another channel every time I quit and rejoin the game
	(don't forget to fix for entity channel, as well)
-Extended player data does not persist through saves or death

	Other things to do next time:
-Add lava world
-add ocean world?
-Add another world, perhaps, with ocean (even up to nearly the build limit) but a glass (or my own block!) floor and possibly somewhat normal world underneath
-Maybe: Add landing type for that? To use for water-covered worlds
-Add my own kind of block, one that's impervious and invisible, but that the player (and only the player) can pass through. Possibly add something with Waila, too
-Check if OpenBlocks is present, if it is, then add type of world covered in inverted sky blocks below an ocean of magma, with relatively sparse tower structures to allow access to subsurface world
-Hmm, it is open source, perhaps I could include the class myself if it's not otherwise included...
-Or add my own, except impervious and invisible to Waila
-Figure out how lighting works and try to make it so that the above water world and the below lava world's subsuraces are treated like normal... and not like they are at light level 0. (one option is just to disable 

	Longer term:
-Look into terrain generation in general, try making a planet that's my own generator entirely (useful for making our own biomes later)
-Look into how to send mails? (asking an admin to look at X log file or something for error that had been caught or something)
-Figure out how to efficiently do certain things... like update a player's knowledge of a planet (like the fact that one actually had a surface like I described above below the magma (they can usze this to update their Star Atlases by hand
