-Appears to be adding another channel every time I quit and rejoin the game
	(don't forget to fix for entity channel, as well)
-Extended player data does not persist through saves or death
-Bugs with mercury for whatever reason, probably because there's a still but no moving version

	Other things to do next time:
-Add lava world
-add ocean world?
-Add another world, perhaps, with ocean (even up to nearly the build limit) but a glass (or my own block!) floor and possibly somewhat normal world underneath
-Maybe: Add landing type for that? To use for water-covered worlds
-Add my own kind of block, one that's impervious and invisible, but that the player (and only the player) can pass through. Possibly add something with Waila, too
-Or add my own, except impervious and invisible to Waila
-Figure out how lighting works and try to make it so that the above water world and the below lava world's subsuraces are treated like normal... and not like they are at light level 0. (one option is just to disable 
-Look at OpenBlocks source to see how to make a block not touchable by players while still being solid
-Update this list
-Add sky rendering components in POPWorld dealing with stars, moons, other planets
-Add atmospheres
-Hmm, clouds are semitransparent, like sky blocks? That should be usefuly knowledge
-Building on that: Try making own cloud generator instead of using Sky-like blocks for world ceiling
-Add more about horizons to match planet's size
-update getStarBrightness, it's used in POPSkyRenderer
-Add my own very small entity of some kind

	Longer term:
-Look into terrain generation in general, try making a planet that's my own generator entirely (useful for making our own biomes later)
-Look into how to send mails? (asking an admin to look at X log file or something for error that had been caught or something)
-Figure out how to efficiently do certain things... like update a player's knowledge of a planet (like the fact that one actually had a surface like I described above below the magma (they can usze this to update their Star Atlases by hand
-Perhaps add a larger oxygen tank as part of the mod?
-And/or a scuba set for use on ocean worlds, using the same oxygen framework?
-Hmm, could use explosions as a world gen tool, potentially... They make interesting patterns
-add lava 

	Look into:
-setBlockBounds(float*6)

South yaw: 0 (+z)
West yaw: 90 (-x)
North yaw: 180 (-z)
East yaw: 270 (+x)
Up pitch: -


Fixed problems:
-Need to fix direction of explosion


Old ideas:
-Check if OpenBlocks is present, if it is, then add type of world covered in inverted sky blocks below an ocean of magma, with relatively sparse tower structures to allow access to subsurface world
-What is MapColor? //Solved: Color used to represent block on a map
