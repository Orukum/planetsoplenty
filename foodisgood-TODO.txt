-Need to fix direction of explosion
-Appears to be adding another channel every time I quit and rejoin the game
	(don't forget to fix for entity channel, as well)
-Extended player data does not persist through saves or death
-Terrain in Superflat West Test Planet is capping itself at y=128

	Other things to do next time:
-Add lava world
-add ocean world?
-Add another world, perhaps, with ocean (even up to nearly the build limit) but a glass (or my own block!) floor and possibly somewhat normal world underneath
-Maybe: Add landing type for that? To use for water-covered worlds
-Add my own kind of block, one that's impervious and invisible, but that the player (and only the player) can pass through
